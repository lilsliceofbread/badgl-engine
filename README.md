# badgl-engine
making a terrible graphics "engine" (barely a framework) to learn c and opengl. DON'T USE THIS

WIP

# requirements

- GPU supporting OpenGL 4.3

- CMake

- gcc/g++

# compilation

run config.sh, then build.sh, then run with run.sh

if on Windows, you may want to either use a program to run the .sh files, or look at the files and use the corresponding Windows commands manually
